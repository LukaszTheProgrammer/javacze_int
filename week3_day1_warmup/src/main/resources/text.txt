  Years from now when the Earth is a post-apocalyptic wasteland,
two clans of semi-truck driving metalheads will still meet
twice a year to duke it out on Summoner’s Rift.
They are Cloud9 and TSM. The two orgs collide in a Best-of-5 for the 10th time this Saturday to kick off,
maybe, the most anticipated LCS Semifinal ever.
  They are joined by FlyQuest and Team Liquid to round out a field of participants
that could all do NA proud at MSI. Here’s 4 thoughts going into Semifinals!

  With all five players on their roster being 1st or 2nd Team All-Pro,
you’d figure Liquid is the runaway favorite to win this entire thing. However,
TSM and C9 also combine to have nine more players rounding out the All-Pro lists,
leaving just FLY’s Santorin as the sole representative outside of the Big Three.
  Which is all to say this is the most competitive Semifinal I can remember — every year there’s usually
only one or two teams that I really want to see represent NA on the international stage,
but this year it feels like any one of TL, TSM, and C9 (sorry, FLY) could do us proud.
  Which means I have no idea who is going to win this split.
I have tried Tarot cards and a magic eight ball and still nothing — not even the SecretScript.doc is finished.
